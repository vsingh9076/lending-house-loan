Create a model that predicts whether or not a loan will be default using the historical data.

Problem Statement:  

For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see later this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Tasks:

1.     Feature Transformation

2.     Exploratory data analysis of different factors of the dataset.

3.     Additional Feature Engineering

4.     Modeling
